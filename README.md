     I used this site to find a lot of functions used for formatting cells, such as the cell color, percentage format, and autofit column width. This is the homepage but there are multiple subpages that I referenced to achieve my results for formatting cells. 
     
3) During office hours while one of the TAs was helping a classmate, I learned the logic behind adding on to the Total Stock Volume for every Ticker by using the 'Else' function in the 'If Then' functions.

    Kevin's video on Intro to VBA. I added this function: 'Application.ScreenUpdating = False' to speed up the code based on what he mentioned in the video to speed up the code process.
    
5) A lot of functions and logic that went behind creating For Loops were learnt and referenced from the class activities that we had such as creating a For Loop for each individual Worksheets.
